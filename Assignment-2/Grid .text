 q2
        What is the difference between Flex and grid
ans=    Difference Between Flexbox and Grid
Flexbox and Grid are both layout systems in CSS, but they serve different purposes:

Flexbox:

One-dimensional layout system.
Primarily used for laying out items in a single direction: either as a row or a column.
Focuses on aligning and distributing space along one axis at a time.
Use Case: Ideal for small-scale layouts like navigation bars, buttons, and single-dimensional lists.
Grid:

Two-dimensional layout system.
Allows for laying out items in both rows and columns simultaneously.
Provides more control over complex layouts with both horizontal and vertical alignment.
Use Case: Ideal for large-scale layouts like entire web pages, dashboards, or complex design structures.

 q3
        How can you define rows and columns for your grid 
ans
Defining Rows and Columns in Grid
To define rows and columns in a grid container, you use the grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns properties. You can specify the size of rows and columns using fixed units (e.g., px, em), relative units (e.g., %, fr), or auto-sizing.

Example:
css
Copy code
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr; /* Creates two columns with relative sizes */
  grid-template-rows: 100px auto; /* Creates two rows with specified heights */
}

q4
        List any two properties of the grid item and grid container. 
ans
Properties of Grid Items and Grid Container
Grid Container Properties:

grid-template-areas: Defines named grid areas to simplify layout and positioning of items.

Example:
css
Copy code
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas:
    "header header"
    "sidebar main"
    "footer footer";
}
grid-gap: Defines the space between rows and columns in the grid.

Example:
css
Copy code
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-gap: 10px; /* Adds 10px gap between rows and columns */
}
Grid Item Properties:

grid-column: Specifies how many columns an item should span and where it should start and end.

Example:
css
Copy code
.grid-item {
  grid-column: 1 / 3; /* Spans from column line 1 to line 3 */
}
grid-row: Specifies how many rows an item should span and where it should start and end.

Example:
css
Copy code
.grid-item {
  grid-row: 2 / 4; /* Spans from row line 2 to line 4 */
}
Summary
CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that allows for complex grid-based designs.
Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system suitable for simpler layouts, while Grid is better for complex, two-dimensional layouts.
Rows and columns in a grid are defined using grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns.
Grid container properties include grid-template-areas and grid-gap, while grid item properties include grid-column and grid-row.
