q1.
Explain the Table and its properties 
ans=>Tables in HTML are used to display data in a structured format with rows and columns. They are commonly used for presenting tabular data such as schedules, statistics, and comparisons. The <table> element and its associated elements define the structure and content of the table.

Key Elements and Properties of HTML Tables
<table>

Defines the entire table.
Example:
html
Copy code
<table>
  <!-- Table content goes here -->
</table>
<tr> (Table Row)

Represents a single row in the table.
Example:
html
Copy code
<tr>
  <!-- Table cells go here -->
</tr>
<th> (Table Header)

Defines a header cell in the table. It is typically bold and centered by default.
Used within a <tr> element to define column headers.
Example:
html
Copy code
<th>Header 1</th>
<th>Header 2</th>
<td> (Table Data)

Represents a standard cell in the table that contains data.
Used within a <tr> element to define the data for each cell in that row.
Example:
html
Copy code
<td>Data 1</td>
<td>Data 2</td>
<caption>

Provides a title or description for the table. It is placed inside the <table> element, typically at the top.
Example:
html
Copy code
<caption>Monthly Sales Report</caption>
<thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot>

<thead>: Groups the header content in the table. Used for grouping <th> elements and providing a header section for the table.
<tbody>: Groups the main content of the table. Contains <tr> elements with <td> elements.
<tfoot>: Groups footer content in the table. Typically used for summarizing or aggregating data at the bottom of the table.
Example:
html
Copy code
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Header 1</th>
      <th>Header 2</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Data 1</td>
      <td>Data 2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
  <tfoot>
    <tr>
      <td>Total</td>
      <td>$1000</td>
    </tr>
  </tfoot>
</table>
Table Properties
border

Defines the width of the table border. By default, HTML tables have no border, but you can specify a border using CSS.
Example:
css
Copy code
table {
  border-collapse: collapse; /* Merges adjacent borders */
}
th, td {
  border: 1px solid black; /* Adds border to table cells */
}
cellpadding

Defines the space between the cell border and its content. This is an older attribute and is now handled using CSS padding.
Example:
css
Copy code
td {
  padding: 10px; /* Adds space inside each cell */
}
cellspacing

Defines the space between table cells. This is also an older attribute and is now handled using CSS border-spacing.
Example:
css
Copy code
table {
  border-spacing: 5px; /* Adds space between cells */
}
width and height

Define the dimensions of the table or its cells. These can be set using CSS for better control.
Example:
css
Copy code
table {
  width: 100%; /* Sets the width of the table */
}
td {
  height: 50px; /* Sets the height of the table cells */
}
align

Defines the alignment of the table. This attribute is deprecated and should be replaced with CSS text-align and vertical-align.
Example:
css
Copy code
table {
  text-align: center; /* Centers table content horizontally */
}
td {
  vertical-align: middle; /* Centers table content vertically */
}
Example of a Complete Table
html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Sample Table</title>
    <style>
        table {
            width: 100%;
            border-collapse: collapse;
        }
        th, td {
            border: 1px solid black;
            padding: 8px;
            text-align: left;
        }
        th {
            background-color: #f2f2f2;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <table>
        <caption>Employee Data</caption>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Name</th>
                <th>Position</th>
                <th>Salary</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>John Doe</td>
                <td>Software Engineer</td>
                <td>$100,000</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Jane Smith</td>
                <td>Project Manager</td>
                <td>$120,000</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
        <tfoot>
            <tr>
                <td colspan="2">Total</td>
                <td>$220,000</td>
            </tr>
        </tfoot>
    </table>
</body>
</html>
Summary
HTML tables are a versatile way to organize and present data. By using semantic elements like <table>, <tr>, <th>, <td>, <caption>, <thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot>, you can create structured and accessible data presentations. Properties and styles can be applied using CSS to customize the appearance and layout of the table.

Explain all Media elements and how they work 
ans.
Media elements in HTML are used to embed and control various types of media content such as images, audio, and video directly within web pages. Here’s an overview of the key media elements in HTML and how they work:

1. <img>
The <img> element is used to embed images in a web page. It is a self-closing tag and requires the src attribute to specify the image source. The alt attribute provides alternative text for the image, which is crucial for accessibility and SEO.

Attributes:

src: Specifies the path to the image file.
alt: Provides alternative text for the image if it cannot be displayed.
width and height: Define the dimensions of the image.
title: Provides additional information about the image (shown as a tooltip on hover).
Example:

html
Copy code
<img src="example.jpg" alt="Description of the image" width="300" height="200">
2. <audio>
The <audio> element is used to embed audio content in a web page. It supports various audio formats and includes built-in controls for playback, volume, and other functions.

Attributes:

src: Specifies the path to the audio file.
controls: Adds playback controls such as play, pause, and volume.
autoplay: Automatically starts playing the audio when the page loads.
loop: Loops the audio playback.
preload: Specifies how the audio should be loaded (e.g., auto, metadata, none).
Example:

html
Copy code
<audio controls>
  <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
3. <video>
The <video> element is used to embed video content. It provides native support for playing video files and includes controls for playback, volume, and other functions.

Attributes:

src: Specifies the path to the video file.
controls: Adds playback controls such as play, pause, and volume.
autoplay: Automatically starts playing the video when the page loads.
loop: Loops the video playback.
muted: Mutes the video by default.
preload: Specifies how the video should be loaded (e.g., auto, metadata, none).
poster: Specifies an image to be shown before the video starts playing.
Example:

html
Copy code
<video width="640" height="360" controls poster="thumbnail.jpg">
  <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="video.ogg" type="video/ogg">
  Your browser does not support the video element.
</video>
4. <picture>
The <picture> element provides a way to specify multiple sources for an image, allowing the browser to choose the best image based on the viewport size, resolution, or other factors.

Attributes:

<source>: Inside the <picture> element, it defines different image sources with media queries.
media: Specifies a media condition (e.g., screen size) for which the source is applicable.
type: Specifies the MIME type of the image.
Example:

html
Copy code
<picture>
  <source srcset="image-small.jpg" media="(max-width: 600px)">
  <source srcset="image-large.jpg" media="(min-width: 601px)">
  <img src="image-default.jpg" alt="Responsive image">
</picture>
5. <embed>
The <embed> element is used to embed external content, such as multimedia files or interactive elements, that cannot be represented using other HTML elements. It is often used for embedding PDF files or interactive applications.

Attributes:

src: Specifies the path to the embedded content.
type: Specifies the MIME type of the embedded content.
width and height: Define the dimensions of the embedded content.
Example:

html
Copy code
<embed src="document.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="600" height="400">
6. <object>
The <object> element is used to embed external resources, such as images, videos, or interactive content. It provides fallback content for browsers that do not support the object.

Attributes:

data: Specifies the path to the external resource.
type: Specifies the MIME type of the external resource.
width and height: Define the dimensions of the embedded content.
Example:

html
Copy code
<object data="example.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="600" height="400">
  <p>Your browser does not support this content.</p>
</object>
Summary
HTML provides several elements to handle different types of media content:

<img>: Embeds images.
<audio>: Embeds audio files with playback controls.
<video>: Embeds video files with playback controls.
<picture>: Provides responsive images based on media queries.
<embed>: Embeds external content like PDFs or interactive elements.
<object>: Embeds various types of external resources with fallback content.
These elements help create rich, interactive web experiences by integrating multimedia content seamlessly into web pages

q3
What is Get and Post in Form 
ans
In HTML forms, GET and POST are two methods used to send form data to a server:

GET: Appends form data to the URL as query parameters, making it visible in the browser's address bar. It is used for retrieving data and should be used for requests that do not modify server state. Limited in data length.

POST: Sends form data in the request body, making it invisible in the URL. It is used for submitting data to the server that may change server state or for larger amounts of data. It is more secure for sensitive information.

Example:

html
Copy code
<form action="/submit" method="GET">
  <input type="text" name="query">
  <button type="submit">Search</button>
</form>

<form action="/submit" method="POST">
  <input type="text" name="username">
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
