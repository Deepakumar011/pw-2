What are the new things introduced in HTML5 
ans=>

HTML5 introduced a range of new features and improvements over its predecessors, aiming to enhance the capabilities of web development and provide better support for modern applications. Here are some of the key new features and changes introduced in HTML5:

1. New Semantic Elements
HTML5 introduced new semantic elements that provide meaning and structure to web content, making it more understandable and accessible:

<header>: Defines a header section for a document or section.
<footer>: Defines a footer section for a document or section.
<nav>: Defines a navigation section.
<article>: Defines a self-contained piece of content that can be distributed independently.
<section>: Defines a section of content, often with a heading.
<aside>: Defines content aside from the main content, such as sidebars or tangentially related content.
<figure> and <figcaption>: Define and provide captions for media content.
2. New Form Controls
HTML5 added several new input types and attributes to improve form functionality and user experience:

Input Types:
<input type="email">: For email addresses.
<input type="tel">: For telephone numbers.
<input type="url">: For URLs.
<input type="date">, <input type="time">, <input type="datetime-local">: For date and time inputs.
<input type="range">: For selecting a value within a range.
<input type="color">: For selecting colors.
New Form Attributes:
placeholder: Provides a hint to the user about what to enter in the input field.
required: Specifies that an input field must be filled out before submitting the form.
pattern: Defines a regular expression for input validation.
3. Multimedia Elements
HTML5 introduced native support for audio and video elements, removing the need for third-party plugins:

<audio>: For embedding audio content.
<video>: For embedding video content.
These elements come with built-in controls and support for various media formats.

4. Canvas Element
<canvas>: Provides a drawing surface for graphics, animations, and other visual content. It allows for dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D and 3D graphics using JavaScript.
5. New API Features
HTML5 introduced several new APIs to support modern web applications:

Web Storage:

localStorage: Provides persistent storage that remains even after the browser is closed.
sessionStorage: Provides temporary storage that is cleared when the page session ends.
Geolocation API: Allows web applications to access the geographic location of the user's device.

Web Workers: Provides a way to run JavaScript in the background, improving performance by offloading tasks from the main thread.

WebSockets: Enables full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, allowing real-time data exchange between client and server.

Offline Web Applications: Supports offline access to web applications using the Application Cache (though this is being replaced by service workers in modern web development).

6. Improved Parsing and Error Handling
HTML5 specifies a more forgiving parsing algorithm that helps browsers handle incorrect or invalid HTML more gracefully. This makes it easier for developers to write and maintain HTML that works consistently across different browsers.

7. Doctype Declaration
<!DOCTYPE html>: Simplifies the doctype declaration, ensuring standards compliance and avoiding the complexities of previous HTML versions.
8. New and Deprecated Attributes
New Attributes:

data-*: Allows embedding custom data attributes on HTML elements.
Deprecated Features:

Certain attributes and elements from previous versions of HTML (such as <font>, <center>, etc.) have been deprecated or removed in favor of CSS for styling and layout.
Summary
HTML5 brings numerous advancements that enhance the capabilities of web development, providing better support for multimedia, improving semantic structure, and introducing powerful new APIs. These features make it easier to build modern, interactive, and high-performance web applications.

What are semantic tags? Give a couple of examples
ans=>

Semantic tags in HTML are elements that convey the meaning or purpose of the content they enclose. They provide a clear and descriptive structure to a web page, making the HTML more readable and easier to understand. Semantic tags help search engines, browsers, and assistive technologies (like screen readers) to better interpret and render web content.

Benefits of Semantic Tags
Improved Readability: Code is more understandable for developers and easier to maintain.
Better Accessibility: Assistive technologies can interpret the content more effectively.
SEO Benefits: Search engines can better understand the structure and importance of content.
Examples of Semantic Tags
<header>

Represents introductory content or a set of navigational links. Typically used for the top section of a page or a section.
Example:
html
Copy code
<header>
  <h1>My Website</h1>
  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
      <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</header>
<footer>

Represents the footer section of a page or section, usually containing contact information, copyright statements, or related links.
Example:
html
Copy code
<footer>
  <p>&copy; 2024 My Website. All rights reserved.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a></li>
    <li><a href="#terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a></li>
  </ul>
</footer>
<nav>

Defines a navigation section, typically containing a list of links for navigating the website.
Example:
html
Copy code
<nav>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="#services">Services</a></li>
    <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
<article>

Represents a self-contained piece of content that could be distributed independently, such as a news article, blog post, or forum post.
Example:
html
Copy code
<article>
  <h2>Breaking News</h2>
  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</p>
</article>
<section>

Defines a section of content, typically with a heading, and is used to group related content together.
Example:
html
Copy code
<section>
  <h2>Our Services</h2>
  <p>We offer a range of services to meet your needs.</p>
</section>
<aside>

Represents content that is tangentially related to the content around it, such as a sidebar or a callout box.
Example:
html
Copy code
<aside>
  <h2>Did You Know?</h2>
  <p>Here’s an interesting fact related to our main content.</p>
</aside>
<figure> and <figcaption>

<figure>: Represents self-contained content, such as an image or a diagram, along with its caption.
<figcaption>: Provides a caption or description for the content inside <figure>.
Example:
html
Copy code
<figure>
  <img src="example.jpg" alt="An example image">
  <figcaption>An example image with a caption.</figcaption>
